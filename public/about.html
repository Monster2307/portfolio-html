<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am Pooja Odedara, a 21-year-old resident of Riga, Latvia. 
  Currently in my third year at Riga Technical University, I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Systems.
   My academic journey has exposed me to an array of courses, enabling me to master programming languages like C, Java,
   Python, XML, JSON, MongoDB, SQL, DBMS, modeling, simulation, and Anaconda (Jupyter), data structres.
  As I progress, I am dedicated to enhancing my skills further, with ongoing efforts to learn HTML, C++,
  and various other technologies relevant to my field of study.</p>

<p>I'm currently learning HTML through a Udemy course, focusing on web development. My aim is to enhance my skills and 
  become a proficient web developer in the future.
 The course is helping me understand HTML and its applications, aligning with my broader goal of mastering various aspects of web development.</p>

<p>In addition to my HTML studies, I'm diving deep into the world of C++ and expanding my grasp of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
 I'm particularly passionate about AI, especially in its role in machine learning, where I'm fascinated by its power to simplify and improve various aspects of our daily lives.
 Moving beyond AI, my exploration extends to the realm of data structures, recognizing their crucial role in building efficient and scalable software.
I'm on a mission to understand these fundamental building blocks that make software applications function seamlessly.
As I strive to become a well-rounded professional, my focus extends to the broad field of software development.
It's not just about mastering languages like C++; it's about understanding the theoretical foundations that make software engineering robust and effective.
I'm dedicated to gaining a nuanced understanding of the entire software development lifecycle, from coming up with ideas to putting them into action and maintaining them.
Beyond formal education, my passion for technology and software development fuels an ongoing hunger for knowledge. 
This commitment is more than just acquiring skills; 
it's about cultivating a deep and lasting connection with the ever-evolving landscape of computer systems.
I'm determined to stay ahead with emerging technologies, seamlessly blending theoretical knowledge with practical applications in the realm of software development.</p>
